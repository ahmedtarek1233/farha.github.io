                <h2>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABYYYYYY</h2>   
             <p>Remember the first time we ever talked? I was drunk af and I didn't know wtf i was doing, but something inside of me told me to text you. I really think that it wasn't me being drunk but rather my sober and concious part of my mind told me that you're not like the other girls and I should really text you and try to get to know you better.</p>            </div>

                    <p2>It was in the same time of the WC and the vibes were amaaaaazingggg. God i really miss those days, talking to eachother during the matches and being so hyped. And of course i would never forget the day I told you that you had to date me if brazil won the Tournament</p2>

                    <p3>My love for you was so strong I couldn't just let you go like that after brazil lost. I cried alot that day and the day after it cos I wanted to see brazil win cos I love Neymar and he really deserved a WC after what he's done for football, and ofc Ronaldo deserves it much more... Much much more than even that fraud Messi. I cried for 2 reasons, the first reason was watching Brazil lose and seeing Neymar and Vini cry, second reason was thinking that's the end of the deal and that you wouldn't date me, which i'm so glad you ignored the deal and dated me anyways. We don't talk abt the day after that, you already know how much I cried after watching my Idol cry live on TV</p3>

                        <p4>I remember when we first dirty talked, it was kinda awkward tbh but keep in my mind we weren't even dating yet. It went smth like I said wanted to eat something but I didn't know what to eat, and you responded with "eat me". I rlly don't remember exactly bro but that's what I can recall. But ofc now we dirty talk however we want and I'm so glad we're much more comfortable with eachother now. Especially those pics u send me bro like I said before it's a really strong sign that you tryst me, considering that you're not a hoe that goes on the internet and shows off thos huge tits of urs and you would only show them to someone you really trust that you will marry one day</p4>

                        <p5>I love how our relationship is so strong. Look at how many times we argued throughout the time we dated yet we never left eachother. The worse that happened was us breaking up for a while but we still always stayed by eachother's side till we both had our break and calmed down and got ready to give this relationship another try and I've never regreatted any of the 2 times I asked you out, I'm so thankful for you bro I thank God everyday that I have this pretty girl called Farha in my life and that I'm gonna date her one day inshallah</p5>

                            <p6>Lastly, I wanna apologize for every mistake I had ever done swwetheart yk damn well I'd never mean to do these mistake and wallah I always try and make less mistakes everyday cos I hate seeing u sad wallah I feel so guilty and I wish you woukd stop telling me that idc because wallah I do and maybe I de seem like idc bc atp there's so much going through my head that it stops operating all of a sudden and I enter a stage I would call it darkness. It's when idk what's happening anymore and how tf did shit get fucked up so fast like this, but when I do snap out of it I try my best to make it up to you. But I just wanna reassure you one ting Farha, I will never ever ever ever leave you wallah till you're the one that leaves me cos I'm so attached I'm so obsessed I'm so in love with this pretty, sexy, cute, gorgeous, stunning, perfect girl called Farha, and I will always love you baby no matter what. Ik this website isn't much, but I do hope it means much more in ur heart and it will always remain on the internet so you can remember me, I love you so much baby</p6>
